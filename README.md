Hello, Iâ€™m Nikki B and I run @Nikki-Coding, a general repository for random code bits I've made over the years. Most of my work is private but if you want to request access, send me an email.

Public Email: sapphiresskies@gmail.com
Languages: C, C++, Java, Python, JS, HTML, CSS, and probably a few others.
Interests: Minor automation, scripts, machine learning, game modding.

Two main groups of material uploaded here: learning/referential material and practical applications.
- Learning/Reference material are learning projects I've done in the past. They can possibly assist you in getting an idea on how certain programs, libraries, or languages can work.
- Practical applications are projects that you could feasibly use. Most of these I keep private to myself, however some may be posted publicly.

If you have any questions or concerns about anything, feel free to contact me about it and I'll respond within a week.
